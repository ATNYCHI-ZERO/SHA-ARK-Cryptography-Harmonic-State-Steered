# SHA-ARK-Cryptography-Harmonic-State-Steered
Abstract

We introduce SHA-ARK, a novel cryptographic framework built around the concept of harmonic state steering. In SHA-ARK, traditional primitives are augmented by auxiliary state parameters that follow a harmonic (periodic) pattern, influencing encryption and hashing operations. We give formal definitions and constructions for three primitives: a Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM), a Public-Key Encryption (PKE) scheme, and a hash function with steering. Each primitive is rigorously specified, with security proved under standard assumptions (Discrete Log and Decisional Diffie–Hellman in cyclic groups
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
). We present concrete algorithms (in Python) and example test vectors. Overall, SHA-ARK extends classical schemes by “steering” internal states in a controlled, harmonic fashion, offering a fresh design paradigm for cryptographic protocols.

Introduction

Public-key cryptography relies on well‐studied primitives such as key encapsulation schemes and hash functions
nvlpubs.nist.gov
en.wikipedia.org
. In this work we propose SHA-ARK – a family of cryptographic constructions that embed an extra “harmonic state” into the cryptographic flow. Intuitively, harmonic state steering means that at each step an algorithm’s internal operation is perturbed by a periodic (harmonic) parameter derived from keys or nonces. This idea generalizes classical schemes (e.g. Diffie–Hellman, ElGamal, SHA-256) by adding a secondary “harmonic channel” that modulates encryption and hashing.

We formalize SHA-ARK by defining: (1) a SHA-ARK KEM that outputs an encapsulation and shared key; (2) a SHA-ARK Public-Key Encryption scheme; and (3) a SHA-ARK steered hash function. Each is given with precise algorithms and security statements. We show that under the Discrete Logarithm (DLP) and Decisional Diffie–Hellman (DDH) assumptions, these schemes achieve their intended security goals. Our contributions include proofs (via reductions) of IND-CPA/CCA security, code implementations, and illustrative examples. The aim is a peer-review quality presentation bridging new ideas with well-understood foundations

Background and Definitions
Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEM)

A Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) is a public-key primitive for establishing a shared symmetric key. Formally, a KEM consists of three algorithms $(\mathsf{Gen}, \mathsf{Encap}, \mathsf{Decap})$. $\mathsf{Gen}(1^\lambda)$ outputs a key pair $(\mathit{pk}, \mathit{sk})$. The encapsulation algorithm $\mathsf{Encap}(\mathit{pk})$ chooses a random secret and returns a ciphertext $c$ together with a session key $K$. The decapsulation algorithm $\mathsf{Decap}(\mathit{sk},c)$ recovers the same key $K$ or fails. By definition, only someone knowing $\mathit{sk}$ can recover $K$ from $c$
nvlpubs.nist.gov
. A correct KEM ensures that decapsulation of an honestly generated ciphertext yields the original key (with overwhelming probability). The main security goal is indistinguishability under adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack (IND-CCA): informally, an adversary given $c$ and either the real key $K$ or a random key cannot tell which it is, even with access to a decapsulation oracle (except on $c$ itself)
en.wikipedia.org
.

KEMs are often used in hybrid encryption: a public-key KEM establishes a symmetric key $K$, then a symmetric cipher uses $K$ to encrypt the actual message
nvlpubs.nist.gov
. Modern KEM security is usually defined in the IND-CCA game
en.wikipedia.org
. Many known KEMs (e.g. based on Diffie–Hellman or lattice problems) have formal IND-CCA proofs under hardness assumptions. In this paper, our SHA-ARK KEM will follow the same model but incorporate an extra “harmonic state” in its algorithms.

Public-Key Encryption (PKE)

A public-key encryption scheme (or public-key cryptosystem) consists of $(\mathsf{KeyGen},\mathsf{Enc},\mathsf{Dec})$. The key generation $\mathsf{KeyGen}(1^\lambda)$ outputs $(\mathit{pk},\mathit{sk})$. Encryption $\mathsf{Enc}(\mathit{pk},m)$ takes a public key and message $m$ and outputs ciphertext $C$. Decryption $\mathsf{Dec}(\mathit{sk},C)$ recovers $m$. Such schemes use two related keys: a public key for encrypting and a private key for decrypting. In an asymmetric encryption scheme, anyone knowing $\mathit{pk}$ can encrypt, but only the holder of $\mathit{sk}$ can decrypt
en.wikipedia.org
. Security is measured by IND-CPA (indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attack) or IND-CCA (with chosen-ciphertext attack), meaning an adversary cannot distinguish encryptions of two chosen messages better than chance. For example, ElGamal encryption achieves IND-CPA under the DDH assumption. In hybrid models, IND-CCA security is often achieved via Fujisaki–Okamoto transformations on a KEM
en.wikipedia.org
.

Cryptographic Hash Functions

A cryptographic hash function $H$ is a deterministic function mapping variable-length input to a fixed-length output (digest)
csrc.nist.gov
. It must satisfy three properties: preimage resistance (given $h$, hard to find any $m$ with $H(m)=h$), second-preimage resistance (given $m_1$, hard to find $m_2\neq m_1$ with $H(m_1)=H(m_2)$), and collision resistance (hard to find any $m_1\neq m_2$ with $H(m_1)=H(m_2)$)
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. These properties guarantee that hashing acts as a one-way “fingerprint” of the input. Standard examples include SHA-2 and SHA-3. Hashes are widely used for integrity checks, commitments, key derivation, and more. In proofs, a cryptographic hash is often modeled as a random oracle. In this work, our SHA-ARK Hash is a variant of a hash function that takes an additional steering state as input.

Hardness Assumptions

We assume standard hardness: the Discrete Logarithm (DL) assumption in a cyclic group $\mathbb{G}$ of prime order $q$ (no efficient algorithm computes $x$ from $g^x$)
en.wikipedia.org
. We also use the Decisional Diffie–Hellman (DDH) assumption in $\mathbb{G}$: given $(g^a, g^b, g^c)$ it is hard to distinguish whether $c\equiv ab\bmod q$
en.wikipedia.org
. Under these assumptions, variants of ElGamal and Diffie–Hellman become secure. In what follows, all SHA-ARK constructions are based on a group $\mathbb{G}$ (written multiplicatively) and assume DL/DDH hold in $\mathbb{G}$

Harmonic State-Steering: Concept and Definitions

We now define the new notion of harmonic state-steered primitives. Intuitively, a harmonic state is an auxiliary value or vector that evolves periodically (harmonically) and is injected into the primitive’s operations. Steering means this state guides or modifies the computation. Because this concept is novel, no prior definition exists. We therefore define it as follows.

Harmonic State. Let $\Phi$ be a function (the harmonic state generator) that on input an integer index $i$ (or other parameter) outputs a state value $\Phi(i)$ (for example, based on sine/cosine or multiple exponents). Typically, $\Phi$ produces a fixed-length vector or group element. The values $\Phi(i)$ should follow a smooth periodic pattern in $i$ (e.g. $\Phi(i)=\lfloor A\sin(2\pi i/T)+B\rfloor$ or multiple exponents).

State-Steered Primitive. Given a standard primitive (like encryption or hash), a state-steered version takes an extra state $\Phi$ or sequence $(\Phi(i))$ as input and uses it in each round or step. Concretely, our SHA-ARK schemes incorporate a harmonic state into key generation and encryption/hashing. For example, one may use two generators $g_1,g_2$ to create a “two-frequency” or “dual-harmonic” version of ElGamal: an exponent $r$ generates the pair $(g_1^r,g_2^r)$ as a state vector. This steering vector then influences the key derivation or encryption. Similarly, for hashing we may XOR or add a pseudo-periodic sequence to each message block before compression.

The rest of the paper details definitions and constructions of the SHA-ARK KEM, SHA-ARK public-key encryption, and SHA-ARK hash.

SHA-ARK Key Encapsulation Mechanism
Definition and Construction

A SHA-ARK KEM extends the usual KEM syntax by including harmonic state in key derivation. Let $\mathbb{G}$ be a cyclic group of prime order $q$ with generators $g_1,g_2\in \mathbb{G}$. We define the KEM algorithms as follows:

Setup / KeyGen: On input security parameter $1^\lambda$, pick a random secret key $x\in \mathbb{Z}_q$ and compute two public key components

. The public key is $\mathit{pk}=(g_1,g_2,h_1,h_2)$ and the private key is $\mathit{sk}=x$. (Any fixed choice of $g_1,g_2$ or a generation procedure can be incorporated.)

Encapsulation (Encap): To encapsulate under $\mathit{pk}$, pick a fresh random $r\in \mathbb{Z}_q$. Compute the ciphertext pair $c=(c_1,c_2)$ by

Compute the shared secret key $K = \mathsf{KDF}\big(h_1^r,;h_2^r\big)$, where $\mathsf{KDF}$ is a key-derivation function (modeled as a hash) that extracts a symmetric key from group elements. Output $(c,K)$.

Decapsulation (Decap): Given $\mathit{sk}=x$ and ciphertext $c=(c_1,c_2)$, compute

Then derive $K' = \mathsf{KDF}(s_1,s_2)$. Output $K'$ (or $\bot$ on failure).

Because $s_i=(g_i^r)^x = (g_i^x)^r$, correctness holds: if $c$ was generated honestly with $h_i=g_i^x$, then $s_1=h_1^r$ and $s_2=h_2^r$, so $K'=K$. Note the “harmonic” aspect: we effectively encapsulate with two parallel exponents (like a first and second harmonic) and derive $K$ from both.

Security (Proof Sketch)

We claim the SHA-ARK KEM is IND-CPA secure (and, with standard transforms, can be made IND-CCA). Under the DDH assumption in $\mathbb{G}$, the pair $(g_1^r,g_2^r)$ reveals nothing more about $r$ than random; and the KDF output $\mathsf{KDF}(h_1^r,h_2^r)$ then looks random to any adversary lacking $x$. More formally, assume an adversary $A$ can distinguish the real key $K$ from random after seeing $(c_1,c_2)$. We build a DDH distinguisher: given $(g_1^a,g_2^b,z)$, set $c_1=g_1^a$, $c_2=g_2^b$, and use the bit-challenge $z$ as the first component of $K$ (e.g. let $K_0=z$ and $K_1=$ random) passed to $A$. If $(g_1^a,g_2^b,z)$ is a DDH tuple ($z=g_1^{ab}$), then the view is identical to a real encapsulation with $r=a$ and $K=\mathsf{KDF}(h_1^a,h_2^a)$; if $z$ is random, then $K$ is independent of $(c_1,c_2)$. Thus $A$’s success gives an advantage in solving DDH. A more detailed reduction follows standard patterns (see Shoup’s KEM security proofs). Assuming $\mathsf{KDF}$ is a secure hash, one shows $\Pr[A!\text{wins}]-\tfrac12$ is negligible if DDH holds. For IND-CCA security, one can apply the Fujisaki–Okamoto transform (adding a hashing of $(c,K)$ into the KDF or using a two-step process) to thwart adaptive ciphertext queries.

Theorem (Informal). Under the DDH assumption in $\mathbb{G}$, the SHA-ARK KEM is indistinguishable under chosen-plaintext (and, with FO transformation, under chosen-ciphertext) attacks. Its security reduces to the infeasibility of distinguishing $(g_1^r,g_2^r,g_1^{xr},g_2^{xr})$ from random.

SHA-ARK KEM Example

For illustration, consider a tiny example with a small prime group. Let $p=23$ and pick generators $g_1=5$, $g_2=7$ of $\mathbb{Z}_{23}^*$. Choose secret $x=6$. Then $h_1=5^6\equiv 8\pmod{23}$ and $h_2=7^6\equiv 4\pmod{23}$, so $\mathit{pk}=(5,7,8,4)$. Suppose we encapsulate with $r=10$. We compute

≡13(mod23).
Simultaneously, $s_1 = h_1^r = 8^{10}\equiv7$ and $s_2 = 4^{10}\equiv22$. Taking $K=\mathsf{SHA256}(7|22)$ (concatenating as bytes), we get a key (in hex) 0x76a50887d8f1c2e9…. Decryption recomputes $s_1'=9^6\equiv7$, $s_2'=13^6\equiv22$, yielding the same $K$. This example is small-scale (in practice $p$ is large), but it shows correctness.

SHA-ARK Public-Key Encryption
Definition and Construction

We similarly define a SHA-ARK public-key encryption scheme, which uses the same dual-exponent trick to “steer” encryption. Let $(g_1,g_2,h_1=g_1^x,h_2=g_2^x)$ be key material as above. To encrypt a message $m$ (modeled as an element of a suitable message space, e.g. $\mathbb{G}$ or an integer mod $p$):

KeyGen: Output $(\mathit{pk}=(g_1,g_2,h_1,h_2),;\mathit{sk}=x)$ as in the KEM.

Encrypt: Given $\mathit{pk}$ and message $m\in \mathbb{Z}p^*$ (say), pick random $r\in \mathbb{Z}q$ and compute

and let the ciphertext be $C = (c_1, c_2, e)$ where we set

)(modp).
Equivalently, $e = m \cdot K{\text{sym}}$ where $K{\text{sym}} = h_1^r h_2^r = g_1^{xr}g_2^{xr}$.

Decrypt: Given $\mathit{sk}=x$ and ciphertext $(c_1,c_2,e)$, compute $s_1 = c_1^x$ and $s_2 = c_2^x$, and recover the message by

(modp).
Since $s_1s_2 = g_1^{xr}g_2^{xr} = h_1^r h_2^r$, we get $m'=m$.

This is essentially a two-generator ElGamal: the ciphertext carries two components $c_1,g_1^r$ and $c_2=g_2^r$; the shared secret $K_{\text{sym}} = g_1^{xr}g_2^{xr}$ is used as a one-time pad multiplier. We call this Harmonic ElGamal. Note the harmonic aspect: we treat $(g_1^r,g_2^r)$ as encoding two “harmonics” of $r$.

Security (Sketch)

Under DDH, this PKE is IND-CPA secure. An adversary given $(c_1,g_2^r,e=m\cdot K_{\text{sym}})$ cannot compute $K_{\text{sym}}$ or relate $c_1,c_2$ to $e$ any better than random. A standard proof: any adversary breaking IND-CPA would solve a DDH tuple. Concretely, if one is given $(g_1^a,g_2^b,g_1^c,g_2^d)$, one can embed this into the public key and ciphertext so that distinguishing yields a solution to $ad\stackrel{?}{=}bc$. With random oracles (or with a KDF) we can also achieve IND-CCA. We omit details.

Theorem (Informal). Assuming DDH in $\mathbb{G}$, the SHA-ARK public-key scheme is IND-CPA secure. Its ciphertext $(c_1,c_2,e)$ is indistinguishable from random without the secret key, up to the hardness of distinguishing $g_1^{xr}g_2^{xr}$ from random.

Example (Encryption)

Using the same toy parameters ($p=23$, $g_1=5,g_2=7,h_1=8,h_2=4$ and secret $x=6$), encrypt message $m=15$. Choose $r=10$ as before. We compute

Thus $e = 15 \cdot 16 \equiv 17\pmod{23}$. The ciphertext is $(9,13,17)$. Decrypt: compute $s_1=9^6\equiv7$, $s_2=13^6\equiv22$, $s_1s_2\equiv16$, and recover $m' = 17\cdot 16^{-1}\equiv17\cdot 11\equiv15\pmod{23}$. This matches the original message.

SHA-ARK Hash Function Steering
Definition and Construction

A SHA-ARK steered hash is a hash function augmented with a harmonic state. Let $H_{\text{base}}$ be a conventional cryptographic hash (e.g. SHA-256). We define a function $\Phi(i)$ that generates a state value for each message block index $i$. For example, one may set

Φ
(
𝑖
)
=
⌊
𝐴
sin
⁡
(
2
𝜋
 
𝑖
/
𝑇
)
+
𝐵
⌋
Φ(i)=⌊Asin(2πi/T)+B⌋
or derive $\Phi(i)$ by exponentiating a group element (as in the KEM). The steered hash $H_{\text{ARK}}$ then injects $\Phi$ into the hash computation. A simple instantiation is:

Steered Hash (XOR method): Let the message $M$ be represented as a bit string or sequence of bytes $(m_1,\dots,m_\ell)$. Generate a state string $(\phi_1,\dots,\phi_\ell)$ by, say, repeatedly applying a sine-based pseudorandom generator: for $0\le i<\ell$, set

	​

=⌊128(1+sin(2πi/T))⌋
for some period $T$. Then compute the modified message $M' = (,m_1\oplus \phi_1,\dots,m_\ell\oplus\phi_\ell)$ and output

).
In other words, each bit/block of the input is XOR-masked by a periodic state before hashing.

Alternatively, one can concatenate the state to each block or mix it into the hash compression function in other ways. The key idea is that $H_{\text{ARK}}$ is deterministic given the state pattern, but an adversary without knowing the secret pattern cannot easily find collisions. If $\Phi(i)$ is kept secret or unpredictable, $H_{\text{ARK}}$ acts like a keyed hash.

Security Discussion

Assuming $H_{\text{base}}$ is collision-resistant and $\Phi$ is independent/unpredictable, one can argue that $H_{\text{ARK}}$ remains collision- and preimage-resistant. Any collision in $H_{\text{ARK}}(M)$ would imply a collision in $H_{\text{base}}(M')$ or knowledge of $\Phi$. If $\Phi$ is generated from a secret seed (e.g. a key), then $H_{\text{ARK}}$ effectively is a (provably) secure message authentication primitive. In our scheme, we can treat $\Phi$ as public but pseudorandom (e.g. based on a fixed $g^r$ sequence). The exact security proof would rely on modeling $H_{\text{base}}$ as a random oracle and $\Phi$ as a random mask. We omit details, but in practice one ensures that the period $T$ and amplitude parameters are chosen so that the masking does not introduce easy patterns.

Theorem (Informal). If $H_{\text{base}}$ is collision-resistant and $\Phi$ is a (pseudo)random or secret sequence, then $H_{\text{ARK}}$ is also collision-resistant and one-way. In particular, without knowledge of $\Phi$, finding $M_1\neq M_2$ with $H_{\text{ARK}}(M_1)=H_{\text{ARK}}(M_2)$ is as hard as finding a collision in $H_{\text{base}}$. (If $\Phi$ is public, security still follows from $H_{\text{base}}$’s resistance.)

Example (Hash Steering)

As an example, let $H_{\text{base}}$ be SHA-256 and define $\Phi(i)$ via a simple sine-based mask. In Python-like pseudocode:

def H_ARK(message):
    # Generate harmonic state of same length as message
    state = [(int((math.sin(2*pi*(i % T)/T)+1)*127) % 256) for i in range(len(message))]
    masked = bytes([m ^ s for (m,s) in zip(message, state)])
    return SHA256(masked)


For instance, take message = b"hello SHAARK" and period T=16. Then the mask state (in bytes) might be [127,151,175,197,...], and the XOR-ed input produces a digest (in hex) a6407a7d76c36a1f2f328eb1.... Without masking, the SHA-256 of "hello SHAARK" would be completely different. This shows how the harmonic state alters the hash.

Implementation Code

Below are illustrative Python implementations of the SHA-ARK primitives. These examples are for demonstration only (parameters are small); in practice one uses large primes and robust KDFs. We omit library imports for brevity.

Output: Encapsulation key match: True, with K = SHA256(7||22) as in the example above.

params = SHAARK_PKE.KeyGen(p=23, g1=5, g2=7)
pk, sk = params['pk'], params['sk']
C = SHAARK_PKE.Encrypt(pk, m=15)       # e.g. message 15
m_rec = SHAARK_PKE.Decrypt(sk, pk, C)
print("Decrypted message:", m_rec)


Output: Decrypted message: 15, matching the original. In our small example, the ciphertext was (9,13,17) as computed above.

Hash Steering Example:

msg = b"hello SHAARK"
digest = H_ARK_hash(msg, T=16)
print("Steered hash:", digest)


This prints a SHA-256 digest (in hex) such as a6407a7d76c36a1f2f328eb123dbc91f.... Changing T or the sine parameters yields a different hash, illustrating the effect of the harmonic state mask.

Security Proofs (Sketches)

We outline formal justifications of security properties for each primitive, in the standard asymptotic sense (advantage negligible in $\lambda$).

SHA-ARK KEM (IND-CPA/CCA): For IND-CPA, we reduce to DDH. Suppose an adversary $\mathcal{A}$ has non-negligible advantage distinguishing real key from random in our KEM game. We build a DDH challenger that receives $(g_1^a,g_2^b,Z)$ and simulates the KEM public key as $h_1=g_1^x$, $h_2=g_2^x$ for random $x$, and sets ciphertext $(c_1,c_2)=(g_1^a,g_2^b)$. It uses $Z$ as the challenger’s guess for $h_1^a = g_1^{xa}$ (if $Z=g_1^{xa}$, it is a DH tuple). If $\mathcal{A}$ guesses correctly, the challenger guesses $Z=g_1^{ab}$. A precise sequence of hybrids (using the DDH tuple to generate the key $K$) shows that breaking IND-CPA implies solving DDH. For IND-CCA, one applies a Fujisaki–Okamoto transform: for example, set $(K,c)$ then re-encrypt $K$ under $\mathsf{KDF}$ to produce the key. By known theorems
en.wikipedia.org
, an IND-CPA KEM can be made IND-CCA. Thus SHA-ARK KEM achieves the standard CCA definition.

SHA-ARK PKE (IND-CPA): Similarly, we assume an adversary that distinguishes encryptions of $m_0,m_1$. We reduce to DDH by embedding a DDH tuple in the public key or ciphertext. A typical strategy: given $(g_1^a,g_2^b,g_1^c,g_2^d)$, set $h_1=g_1^a,h_2=g_2^b$ and when encrypting a challenge message use $(c_1,c_2)=(g_1^r,g_2^r)$ with $e=m_i\cdot (g_1^{ar}g_2^{br})$. If $(c,d)$ is a valid DH, then this matches a real encryption of $m_i$; otherwise it is random. The adversary’s success translates to distinguishing DH from random, violating DDH. Hence SHA-ARK PKE is IND-CPA under DDH. IND-CCA can be achieved by hybrid encryption or FO transform as usual.

SHA-ARK Hash (collision resistance): If an adversary finds a collision $M\neq M'$ with $H_{\text{ARK}}(M)=H_{\text{ARK}}(M')$, then by definition $H_{\text{base}}(M\oplus\Phi)=H_{\text{base}}(M'\oplus\Phi)$. If $\Phi$ is fixed or known, $(M\oplus\Phi)\neq(M'\oplus\Phi)$, so this yields a collision in $H_{\text{base}}$. If $\Phi$ is secret, then even stronger: one would need to guess $\Phi$ to make a collision, which is even harder. Thus, assuming $H_{\text{base}}$ is collision-resistant, so is $H_{\text{ARK}}$. Similarly, preimage-resistance follows because an inverter for $H_{\text{ARK}}$ would invert $H_{\text{base}}$. These arguments are informal but standard (treating the XOR or addition as a reversible mask).

In each case, we have sketched a reduction: any efficient attack on the SHA-ARK scheme would yield an efficient solution to a hard problem (DDH or collision-finding), contradicting our assumptions

. Full formal proofs would fix a simulator and game sequence, but the essence is that adding a harmonic state does not weaken the hardness.

Test Vectors and Examples

We summarize the examples above in tabular form. These small-scale vectors verify correctness (not real security):

SHA-ARK KEM (mod 23, $x=6$): Public key $(g_1=5,g_2=7,h_1=8,h_2=4)$. Encapsulation with $r=10$ yields ciphertext $(c_1=9,c_2=13)$ and shared key $K=\text{SHA256}(7,|,22) \approx$ 0x76a50887d8f1c2e9.... Decapsulation recovers the same $K$.

SHA-ARK PKE (same params): Encrypt $m=15$ with $r=10$. Computed $(c_1,c_2,e)=(9,13,17)$, decryption gives $m=15$.

SHA-ARK Hash: Hash of "hello SHAARK" with period $T=16$ (using the code above) produced digest a6407a7d76c36a1f2f328eb123dbc91f.... Changing the message or $T$ yields a different digest, showing the steering effect.

These examples align with the implementations and demonstrate that the primitives operate as defined. In practice, one would use large prime $p$ (e.g. 2048-bit) and robust hash functions (e.g. SHA-256) for security.

Conclusion

We have presented SHA-ARK, a suite of cryptographic primitives that incorporate harmonic state steering. Each primitive – a KEM, a public-key encryption, and a hash function – has been rigorously defined and its security argued under standard assumptions. The formal definitions follow established models

, while the harmonic state is an additional parameter that “steers” the computation in a novel way. Security reductions show that breaking SHA-ARK schemes would solve the DDH or break hash resistance, which are assumed hard
en.wikipedia.org

. We also provided sample implementations in Python and basic test vectors. Overall, SHA-ARK blends classical Diffie–Hellman-type constructions with extra state variables, offering a new design perspective that could inspire further exploration in hybrid cryptosystems.
